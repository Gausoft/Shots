## Build setup
Your system requires the Flutter SDK. Follow the steps here to [install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) it on your system. After Flutter is installed, clone or fork this repository.

Once Flutter has been set up, run the app with

```
flutter run
```

The main app entry point is `main.dart`, then `app.dart`.

### Build Android APK and appbundle
```
flutter build appbundle
flutter build apk
```

It is possible that the app is on your Android device, but not fully installed. To delete it completely, connect your device to your computer, and run the following command:

```
adb uninstall com.themindstorm.shots
```

Once the APK has been built, install it on a physcally connected Android device:
```
flutter install
```
